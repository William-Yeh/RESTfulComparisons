# Financial Data

This project aims at showing differences in implementing the same bit of functionality with different programming languages or frameworks.

The applications developed in this project are providing some RESTful endpoints (HTTP GET, POST, etc.) where some path/query parameters 
can be specified, then the idea is to retrieve a JSON object from a remote API according to those parameteres, then adapting that remote JSON to some specific needs (get/set etc.), 
then showing the outcome as a reply to the original request to the RESTful endpoints.

## Implementations

* [Node.js RESTful implementation](./node-implementation/README.md)
* [Java RESTful implementation](./java-implementation/README.md)
* [Go (golang) RESTful implementation](./go-implementation/README.md)
